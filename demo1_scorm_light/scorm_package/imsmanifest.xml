SCORM 1.2 MANIFEST FILE (imsmanifest.xml)
==============================================================================

WHAT IS THIS FILE?
------------------
This is the "table of contents" for a SCORM package. When an LMS imports a 
SCORM course, it reads this file to understand:
  - What the course is called
  - What files are included
  - How the course is organized
  - Which file to launch first

KEY TERMINOLOGY:
----------------
• MANIFEST: This entire XML file describing the course
• ORGANIZATION: The structure/hierarchy of the course (like a table of contents)
• ITEM: A single launchable unit (like a chapter or lesson)
• RESOURCE: A file or collection of files that make up an item
• SCO (Sharable Content Object): Content that communicates with the LMS via JavaScript

SCORM 1.2 vs SCORM 2004:
------------------------
We're using SCORM 1.2 because:
  - It's simpler and has wider LMS support
  - The API object is called "API" (vs "API_1484_11" in 2004)
  - Data model elements use "cmi.core." prefix (vs "cmi." in 2004)
  - It's sufficient for basic completion tracking

IMPORTANT:
----------
The file MUST be named exactly "imsmanifest.xml" (lowercase) and MUST be at
the root of your ZIP file for the LMS to recognize it as a SCORM package.

<!-- 
The <manifest> tag is the root element. Key attributes:
  - identifier: A unique ID for this course (can be anything unique)
  - version: The version of YOUR course (not SCORM version)

  <!--
  METADATA SECTION
  ================
  Contains information ABOUT the course (like a book's title page).
  This is optional but recommended for LMS course catalogs.
  -->
  <metadata>
    <!-- Tells the LMS this follows SCORM 1.2 standards -->
    <schema>ADL SCORM</schema>
    <schemaversion>1.2</schemaversion>
  </metadata>

  <!--
  ORGANIZATIONS SECTION
  =====================
  Defines the structure of the course. A course can have multiple organizations
  (like different "views" of the same content), but typically has just one.
  
  The "default" attribute points to which organization to use.
  -->
  <organizations default="TOC1">
    
    <!-- 
    Single organization with ID "TOC1" 
    The <title> appears in the LMS course player's navigation.
    -->
    <organization identifier="TOC1">
      <title>SCORM Light Wrapper Demo</title>
      
      <!--
      ITEM ELEMENT
      ============
      Each <item> is a launchable piece of content (like a lesson or module).
      
      Attributes:
        - identifier: Unique ID for this item
        - identifierref: Points to a <resource> that defines the files to launch
        - isvisible: Should this appear in the LMS navigation? (default: true)
      
      For simple courses, you'll have just one item.
      Complex courses might have nested items creating a hierarchy.
      -->
      <item identifier="ITEM1" identifierref="RESOURCE1" isvisible="true">
        <title>External Content Demo</title>
        
        <!--
        ADL:MASTERYSCORE (Optional)
        ===========================
        If you were tracking scores, this sets the passing threshold.
        We're not using scores in this demo, but including for reference.
        
        <adlcp:masteryscore>80</adlcp:masteryscore>
        -->
      </item>
      
    </organization>
  </organizations>

  <!--
  RESOURCES SECTION
  =================
  Lists all files in the package and groups them into resources.
  Each <resource> is like a "package within the package."
  
  Key attributes:
    - identifier: Unique ID (referenced by <item identifierref>)
    - type: Always "webcontent" for SCORM
    - adlcp:scormtype: "sco" means it communicates with LMS, "asset" means static content
    - href: The file to launch (relative to manifest location)
  -->
  <resources>
    
    <!--
    Our main (and only) resource.
    
    scormtype="sco" is CRITICAL - it tells the LMS that this content will:
      - Call LMSInitialize() when it starts
      - Call LMSSetValue() to report progress
      - Call LMSFinish() when done
    
    If you used "asset" instead, the LMS wouldn't expect API calls.
    -->
    <resource identifier="RESOURCE1" type="webcontent" adlcp:scormtype="sco" href="launch.html">
      
      <!--
      FILE ELEMENTS
      =============
      List every file that's part of this resource.
      This helps the LMS know what files belong to the course.
      
      For our minimal demo, we only have two files.
      A real course might list dozens of HTML, CSS, JS, and image files.
      -->
      <file href="launch.html"/>
      <file href="scorm_api_proxy.js"/>
      
      <!--
      Note: We DON'T list the external content files here because
      they're hosted separately (on GitHub Pages), not in this package.
      -->
      
    </resource>
    
  </resources>

</manifest>

COMMON ISSUES & DEBUGGING TIPS:
===============================

1. "Course won't import"
   - Check that imsmanifest.xml is at the ROOT of the ZIP (not in a subfolder)
   - Validate XML syntax (use an online XML validator)
   - Ensure identifier values are unique

2. "Course imports but won't launch"
   - Check that the href in <resource> points to an existing file
   - Verify the file has the correct SCORM API calls

3. "Course launches but doesn't track"
   - Ensure scormtype="sco" (not "asset")
   - Verify your JavaScript is calling the API correctly

4. "LMS shows wrong title"
   - Update the <title> elements in this manifest
   - Some LMS systems cache - try re-importing

TESTING TOOLS:
==============
- ScormCloud (cloud.scorm.com) - Free tier available, great for testing
- SCORM Test Track - Validates your package structure
- Browser Developer Tools - Check console for JavaScript errors
